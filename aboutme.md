**Why I chose to build games:**
Human connections are magical. Imagine the feeling that you get when you feel gratitude for your selfless mentors, love for your close ones, regret in missed opportunities, strength in preparation, hope in desperate situations. These emotional connections that we have with one another, shape us. 

I have noticed that this magic can scale. Books, cinema, and games have this distinct ability to scale this human connection to millions of readers, watchers, and players around the world. And amongst these three, games are the most powerful of them all. Deep human connections. At scale. Sheer magic.

This is why I build games.
